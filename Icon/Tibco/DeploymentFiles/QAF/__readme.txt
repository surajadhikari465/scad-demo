[QAF Folder/QA-FUNC Fileset]
These files are for the dedicated IRMA "QA" TIBCO servers, delivered end of April 2018.

Starting with this release (early May 2018), the exported config files will be in the env folder with the other deploy artifacts,
because different envs have different instances, which are in the XML config for now.

See IRMA Apps Wiki for more details on TIBCO deployment files and process.
