# Icon.Esb.Schemas.Wfm

Icon.Esb.Schemas.Wfm contains the C# classes generated by XSDs from the Data Delivery Systems (DDS) team. These classes can be serialized and deserialized for messaging between systems throughout the enterprise.

## Custom Types

Added TraitsType.cs for Attribute messaging. This type is in the XSDs but is not being auto-generated by the CodeGenerator project so need to add it manually here. If later we can figure out why this class is auto-generated and update the XSDs to have them then we can remove this class.
